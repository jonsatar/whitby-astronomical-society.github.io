                  The website is a community based organization that seeks to connect those interested in Space as well as related sciences. Since expertise in these fields is few and far between, a modern and attractive website would garner new and significant interest especially from youth who are most impacted by an early appreciation of such a difficult topic. 
                </p>
                <p>The website highlights several accomplishments that have occurred in the recent and far past through various banners, sliders, and news bulletins. It also features a traditional newsletter and interactive quiz for further engagement. Repeat visists are encouraged from contact and membership pages. An accordion was implemented to make more interactive those who may have questions about the role of the club.</p>

                  State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your
                  website. These could include guest speakers, other websites,
                  artists, developers etc.
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <p>The website was first inspired by the Whitby and District Astronomical Society of the UK that was reformulated for the
                    town of Whitby located in Canada.However, the website itself was very information heavy and the content could be more
                    attractive to users as well as more accessible. Animated effects would greatly improve the aesthetics. Nevertheless, the
                    darker background contrasted with white text was maintained in my website as a great feature for higher contrast in the
                    visually impaired.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>The website also borrows many thematic elements, that are then independently coded, from the Microsoft News website.
                    There existed many unique sliders and variable sized boxed divisions for news headings that allowed for very interactive
                    and responsive content. This was mimicked in my website as well.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      <p> An interactive quiz was incorporated to help further retain users. The quiz itself draws upon common knowledge of
                      space that entices visitors of the site to see through to the quiz's completion, and the feedback score at the end
                      would further boost enjoyability, since the quiz is quite simple on the subject matter it inquires. </p>

                    <p>Svg animations were used to create a very stylish circle for navigation with varying background.

                    <p>Learning to use Jquery drastically simplified the resulting code for repeating the navigation and footer sections used throughout all the five pages.

                  What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why?
                </p>
                <p>I think the color aesthetics created a very visually display of space imagery. These allowed for attractive interactions with the user when incorporated with javascript effects. The opening banner on the home page with shows a satellite dish hovering baove earth and beaming electromagnetic waves from its antenna while asteroids are moving through the visual space was a very effective layering of components. COnsiderable time wa put into these aethetics since it is the point at which most users will decide whether they would coontinue navigating through the website.  </p>
                <p>Encouraging further interaction through contact forms and registration to access particular sections and articles were incorporated in a user friendly atmosphere. This was to boost return business.</p>

                <p>
                  What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might
                  you do things differently another time?
                </p>
                <p>I think that more content could have been added as well as several more extensive usages of the javascript libraries. Since these were learned more towards the end of the project timeline there was not signiifcant time remaining in order to incorporate additional functionalities with the jquery and bootstrap libraries. Furthermore, the moustache templates discussed in the lectures from the cousrse would have been interesting to incorporate, however, once again, there was limited time. It seems that they could have made some of the implementations a little more easier.</p>
