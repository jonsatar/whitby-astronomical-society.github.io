                  <h2>The Pale Blue Dot by Carl Sagan</h2>
                  <p>Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it
                  everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of,
                  every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate
                  of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions,
                  ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every
                  hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every
                  king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father,
                  hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every
                  corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every
                  saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there -- on a
                  mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the
                  rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in
                  glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a
                  fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the
                  inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely
                  distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their
                  misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent
                  their hatreds.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we
                  have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this
                  point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great
                  enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there
                  is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from
                  ourselves.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is
                  nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could
                  migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment
                  the Earth is where we make our stand.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building
                     experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of
                     human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it
                     underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another,
                     and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've
                     ever known.
                  </p>

The telescope was successfully launched on Christmas day 2021 to excellent fanfare and is now circling comfortably at its Lagrange point more than a million miles from Earth.
